# Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains my structured journey of learning and implementing core machine learning algorithms with a strong focus on practical understanding, experimentation, and evaluation.

The goal of this repository is not just to "cover algorithms", but to understand when to use them, when they fail, and how to apply them to real-world datasets in a clean and structured way.

## 📚 What This Repository Covers

### Core Supervised Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Supporting Models
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM - Basic Understanding)

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Each algorithm folder contains:

- Short conceptual notes (problem it solves, strengths, limitations)
- Clean implementation notebook
- Dataset used for experimentation
- Evaluation metrics and comparison
- Observations and mistakes encountered

The focus is on:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Practical intuition over theoretical memorization

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each algorithm has its own dedicated folder containing:

- Notes (`.md`)
- Implementation notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Dataset used for practice
- Supporting files (if required)

There is also a `00-ml-concepts` folder covering foundational ideas like:

- Bias vs Variance
- Overfitting & Underfitting
- Train-Test Split
- Evaluation Metrics

---

## 🎯 Objective

This repository is being built as part of a focused preparation plan toward:

- Machine Learning / Data Science Internship roles
- Strong practical ML foundation
- Building industry-ready project thinking

The emphasis is on clarity, structure, and real understanding rather than superficial coverage.

## 🚀 Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📌 Note

This is an actively evolving repository. Improvements, refinements, and additional experiments will be added as learning progresses.
